  # By declaring datasetInput as a reactive expression we ensure that:

  #
  #  1) This expression is automatically called to recompute the output 
  #  2) The new caption is pushed back to the browser for re-display

  # Note that because the data-oriented reactive expressions below don't 
  # depend on input$caption, those expressions are NOT called when 
  # input$caption changes.
